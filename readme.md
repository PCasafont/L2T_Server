# L2T Server

Yet another l2j server branch

## How to run the server

- Install Intellij IDEA and open this as a project.
- Copy any of the example config files in the /config folder and name it local.properties.
- Modify the database configurations to match your setup.
- Modify the connection configurations for your computer.
    Example for localhost:
    GameserverHosts=127.0.0.1
    GameserverSubnets=0.0.0.0/0
- Find java/l2server/gameserver/Server.java in the project explorer, right click it and run/debug it.
- Enjoy!
