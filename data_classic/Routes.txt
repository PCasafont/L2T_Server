Possible "repeatStyle" are:
- "back": NPC moves from first point to last point, then moves back through last point but one, and so on to the first point.
- "cycle": NPC moves from first point to last point, then moves directly to the first point.
- "conveyor": NPC moves from first point to last point, then teleports directly to the first point.
- "random": NPC randomly moves between points.
