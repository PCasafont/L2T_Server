<body>Magister Genovia:<br>
True, there's a lot of clamoring these days about the return of Shilen. Those claiming to be her "children" stir up
trouble everywhere, it seems. Yes, we Dark Elves call ourselves her children as well, but not in the same sense. In
fact, I have been tasked by our Elders with silencing those others before they cause even more problems for our
people.<br>
I am not skilled in using weapons, but I have some other useful skills...<br>
