It's a misperception to think that Giran is filled only with fat and idle merchants. In fact, because of those
merchants, there are more guards and sentinels needed here than in most other cities.<br>
Most of the mercenaries hired by the Merchant Guild Association have been trained in this Warrior Guild. They are as
skilled fighters as any you'll find in any land.<br>
