<body>Head Priest of the Earth Daichir:<br>After much preparation, we're finally ready to march and destroy Earth Wyrm
Trasken! Thus, come back after forming a coalition by recruiting the best warriors with sufficient strength! I think the
ideal number of warriors should be about <font color="LEVEL">100</font>. However, those who don't meet our highest level
of qualification will not be included in these 100 warriors. They will be able to participate for the purpose of
support!<br>You are not yet capable enough to be included in the coalition to destroy Earth Wyrm Trasken. However, you
can still help. You may operate independently, but when it gets dangerous join the coalition.<br><a
