<body>Today's Tip:<br>CP(Combat Will Point: Fight) gauge is used as extra HP in pvp situations. When you fight with
other character, a character's servitor or pet, this CP gauge will be depleted first and then subsequently HP starts to
be depleted. Some skills may deplete HP first.<br><br><br><a action="bypass -h Quest AdventurerHelper showRandom">[See
