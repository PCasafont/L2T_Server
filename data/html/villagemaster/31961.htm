<html><body>Head Blacksmith Newyear:<br>
Do you know when the blacksmiths of Schuttgart Territory are the happiest? It's the moment we walk out of our shop and breathe in that cold fresh air after working long hours surrounded by scorching heat and banging noise. That moment feels like heaven!<br>
How many other occupations in this world can give you such an amazing feeling? That's why I really love this job. I suppose it's really my calling in life, eh?<br>
