<body>Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
There used to be plenty of work for us blacksmiths here in Aden Town, especially with war with Elmore always on the
horizon. Tapoy of the Black Anvil Guild did very well for himself in those days, I can tell you...<br>
I thought that when those wearisome wars were finally over I would have time enough for my other interests, but we seem
busier than ever these days...<br>
