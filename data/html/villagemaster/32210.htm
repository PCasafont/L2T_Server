<body>Grand Master Eddy:<br>
Good day. I am Grand Master Eddy of the Kamael Guild. Why are you staring at me like that? Ah...let me guess. You met
Ferdinand, I suspect. Or perhaps you simply heard rumors of a sweet, gentle Grand Master of the Kamael Guild. Well, as
you can see, you are mistaken. I am not Ferdinand, nor do I spend my days laughing and loafing about. If I seem grim, it
is because I am more conscious of the gravity of my position that that overgrown child ever will be.<br>
