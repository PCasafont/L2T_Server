<html><body>Grand Master Barta:<br>
Greetings! Ah, this is the most pleasant moment of my day, meeting a young Kamael like yourself in a small town like this. Granted, there are other Kamael masters, but they are so stiff and formal. They have no fire in the bellies for adventure -- not like you youngsters. Tell me, have you had any exciting adventures lately?<br>
