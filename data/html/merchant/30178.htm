<body>Merchant Zenkin:<br>
Come on in, customer! Welcome to the most honest shop in northern Aden.<br>
There are people spreading nonsense that I, Zenkin, am a wanted criminal from Elmore or a disguised Timak Orc. Can you
believe those lunatics? Well, you look like you can tell a hawk from a handsaw, so I trust you won't believe such
ridiculous tales.<br>
Anyway, have a look around. Let me know if you see anything you like, eh?<br>
