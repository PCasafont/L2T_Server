Hello, honored traveler. Welcome to Aden Village.<br>
If you leave the village and follow the road to the east, you will come to the National Cemetary in which the royalty and holy ones have been buried since the time of Elmoreden and I recommend you go take a look sometime. Of course, the unifying king His Royal Highness Raoul and the previous kings are all sleeping there.<br>
But recently, the upkeep of the cemetary has been neglected... Those troublesome magpies...<br>
