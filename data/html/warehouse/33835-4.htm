<body> Our "Iron Gate" guild has came up with an amazing stuff after months of research. It's called "Wondrous Cubic".
This item can make various types of "Cube Fragments".<br>
However, this item can only be used once a day, which has made it somewhat difficult to collect the fragments. How about
it? If you bring the cubic fragments to me, I will exchange them for various scrolls and items. If you don't have a
Wondrous Cubic, go see Helvetia in Giran village. She will tell you how to get it.<br>
(The Wondrous Cubics can be used everyday from 6:30 am.)
