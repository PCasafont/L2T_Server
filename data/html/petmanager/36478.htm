Through the restore function, you can transform a pet that has been evolved into a special form back to its original form. Since the process transfers the experience value, restoring a high level pet might actually result in a decrease in the pet's level.<br>
Any items in the pet's inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.<br>
Which pet would you like to restore?<br><br>
