Each team has a flag and the target of the event is to capture the enemy's flag and deliver it to yours.<br>
How is it done? First you have to touch their flag. If you do, their flag will disappear and you will get a hero aura. Then, to complete the flag capture, you will have to return without dying and touch your team's flag.<br>
To make a flag re-appear its wearer has to die or complete its capture.<br>
The team which has captured more flags wins.
