This is a peaceful event. During the event you have to follow the instructions given by the event pressing the social emotes.<br>
The character pressing last gets disqualified. Pressing the wrong emote eliminates you from the game too.<br>
The last person still in the event will be the winner. The amount of Glittering Medals depends on the number of participants.
