These altars can be used to spawn the ancient creatures, these creatures are so strong and only the true heroes will be able to beat them.
<br>
Each time one of these ancient creatures is killed, the altar where was trapped disappears and appears again after few minutes at other location around the world.
<br>
All these ancient creatures drops <font color=LEVEL>Blue Eva</font> that can be used on the Altars shop located at each altar.
<br>
Only a party of 4 non dual boxed players will be able to summon an ancient creature.
