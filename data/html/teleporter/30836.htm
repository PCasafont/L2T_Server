Hardin's Academy is not a place for sightseeing. Do you know what kind of people Necromancers are? For them, even Human
blood, flesh, bones and skin are simply ingredients for their dark spells. They are as emotionless about death as the
cruelest Dark Elves... They are not to be trifled with.<br>
Are you having second thoughts? If you wish to leave here, I will open the door of space and time. I can send you
wherever you wish.<br>
