<html><head><body>Rumiese:<br>Are you really ready, physically and mentally? Do not underestimate Istina's power, especially here on her home turf. <br>
If you still believe you have a chance, we will help you by weakening Istina with the magical power Ballista. <br>
Istina's creative power is generated by the soul stone in her body. Regular attacks won't even scratch the soul stone, but by concentrating your magical power into a huge attack with the Ballista, we can damage her. I will give you more details once you are inside the cavern. Are you ready to enter now?<br>Also, do you have the <font color="LEVEL">Energy Controller</font>? You will need it for this fight. <br><br>
