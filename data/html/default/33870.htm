Hardin:<br>
Darkness and light must be balanced. The only thing tipping that balance is the Power of Chaos. <br>
The lord of chaos doesn't want the world agitated by someone else. Darkness has taken over more than half the world already.<br>
So he wants to restore the power of light to balance the darkness. Would you like to receive the Power of Chaos? <br>
According to his will, it is possible to fuse two totally different powers in you. <br>
You might want to do it now before you change your mind.
