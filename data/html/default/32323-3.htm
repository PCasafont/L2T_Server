<body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
After you have been guided through the process of transformation by a wizard, you may transform yourself into another
shape by bringing a transform sealbook to me.<br>
Know that it is no easy task to earn one. I have heard, however, that you may find one through the Marketeer of Mammon
or the Adventure Guild.<br>
