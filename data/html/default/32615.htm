<body>Maestro Ishuma:<br>
Mammon Tribe is mistaken. People should go with the flow into the world, not the other way around. A blacksmith should
learn the steel, they can't make a top quality by treating it as they wish.<br>
The boats from here go to Gracia? There aren't many people in the current Black Anvil who can deal the items coming from
Gracia. Even if they can, they won't easily come forth because they have other duties to perform. But it's a different
story for members of Mammon.<br>
Fortunately, I have the skills without any duties I'm responsible for, so I believe I can do what you want. Let's see,
do you need anything?<br>
