<body>Valakas Watchman Klein:<br>
The Hall of Flames is a passage leading to Fire Dragon Valakas. The dragon's minions are guarding it, but if you can
break through them, Valakas is just beyond. People are prevented from walking in here like this, so no one could enter
this perilous place unwittingly....<br>
Despite all that, do you still insist upon entering the Hall of Flames? Then talk to me again when you have a Single-use
Floating Stone. Then I'll send you up to the mouth of the Hall of Flames.
