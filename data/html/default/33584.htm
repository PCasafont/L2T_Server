Rebuilding ruins takes all kinds of materials, you know. One's trash is another's treasure, right? Tell you what, you bring me junk and I'll give you a Fortune Treasure Chest. Win for you, win for me...plus a tiny transaction fee.<br>
You might have some in your inventory right now. Don't you have common materials Lv. 1-3, or some crystals?<br>
