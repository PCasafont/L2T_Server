<body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>I am Theodric, the watchful eye over Earth Dragon Antharas...<br>
I watch every movement made by that cursed Shilen's creature, even in slumber...it is a lonely fate, but I have given my
body and soul to this sacred duty, even when it meant selling my soul to darkness to become an immortal Undead.<br>
Even if you enter this cave, you cannot reach Antharas' nest. The entrance has been tightly shut by the Guardians of the
Seals. If you wish to enter, use a <font color="LEVEL">Portal Stone</font> to activate the <font color="LEVEL">Heart of
    Warding</font>. <br>
