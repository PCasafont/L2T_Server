<body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br><br>

Very well. Yes, you are truly the one sent by mother Shilen... Listen carefully as I tell you about the dinosaurs that
may contain Gazkh fragments.<br>
You will encounter prdatory dinosaurs such as <font color="#ffff66">Velociraptor and Pterosaur.</font> They are not as
strong as Sailren, but vicious nevertheless. These are the most likely to containt the fragments. <br>
Go and hut them -- find the fragments! Remember, you must return with at least <font color="#ffff66">30</font>
fragments. If you bring me 30 fragments or more, I will reforge them into an intact axe head.
Ah, could our deliverance finally be at hand?<br><br>
May Shilen help you strike true!
