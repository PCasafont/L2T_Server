You have brought all the Gazkh fragments!<br> <br>
Shilen be praised! The power of the seal stones to guard that dangerous Sailren will be increased now that an Elrokian
warrior again wields Gazkh. <br><br>
You are indeed the chosen of Shilen! <br><br>
The task is now yours. Are you ready to face the monsters within? <br><br>
