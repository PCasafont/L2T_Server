You still don't have <font color="LEVEL">5 </font>Evil Weapons. You can obtain more from the <font color="LEVEL">Lesser
    Evils and Greater Evils in the Monster Foundry</font>. Do your best! If you collect <font color="LEVEL">200 Evil
    Weapons</font>, I will exchange them for the S80 Grade weapon recipe. If you prefer, I can also exchange 5 Evil
Weapons for 3 S80 Grade weapon pieces. <br>
Do you want to continue?<br>
