Are you ready? I want to tell you more about the task.<br>
I want you to defeat the Husk Crawlers in the Training Grounds Underground Facility. First you must take the key I gave you to <font color="LEVEL">Holden</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Training Grounds Underground Facility Entrance</font>. Tell him you've come to defeat the Husk Crawlers, and he'll let you in.<br>
If you lose the key, come back to me. Once you've defeated all the Husk Crawlers, report to <font color="LEVEL">Shannon</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Training Grounds</font>.
