To tell you about myself, I can say that I was one of the initial members of the coin collecting club. Other folks made
fun of me for gathering various things, but I was simply collecting coins. However... Due to a number of different
reasons, I'm still at level 3...<br>

        color="LEVEL"> Silver Unicorn, Gold Wyvern or Blood Medusa coins</font>.<br>
