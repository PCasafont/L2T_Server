You are most understanding.<br>
I feel I can relax around you a little.<br>
I'm Rafforty, I work in the Jinia guild.<br>
I'm sorry for testing you like that, I wouldn't have if it wasn't necessary. I really do have better manners than that. You're not related to Freya queen. So now we'd like to ask for your help. Will you lend us your considerable strength?<br>
Or should I tell you more first?<br>
