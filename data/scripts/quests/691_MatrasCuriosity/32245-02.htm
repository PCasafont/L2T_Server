You know I am kneenly interested in the magnificent structure called the Steel Citadel. I have been researching it, but strangely I have found no complete blueprints. It seems that it was built independently by a number of diferent parties... I am still searching for additional information, but without success.<br>
Would you be willing to help me?<br>
