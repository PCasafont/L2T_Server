<body>Warehouse Chief Baxt:<br>
I've arranged 9 numbers on the panel. Don't peek! Ha ha ha!<br>Now give me your 10 medals. Some players run away when
they realize that they don't stand a good chance of winning. Therefore, I prefer to hold the medals before the game
starts. If you quit during game play, you'll forfeit your bet. Is that satisfactory?<br>Now, select your first number.
