You look like you're ready for action. If so, I have a mission for you.<br>
I'd like you to enter the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction</font>. Since Dragonkin assumed power there, it has
become a extremely violent and dangerous place. A skilled adventurer like you may do a great deal of good there.<br>
