<body>Master Talbot:
<br>Welcome!<br>
I am Talbot, human skillmaster, here to explain the benefits and drawbacks of the classes we can choose from.<br><font
        color="LEVEL">Human Fighters</font> mainly employ short-range melee attacks, and can handle most basic weapons
and armor types.<br><font color="LEVEL">Human Mages</font> have an innate affinity for the power of the spoken word.
They use Elemental Magic, White Magic, Supplemental Magic, Dark Magic and Summon Magic! <br>As your strength grows,
you'll notice a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window automatically show up</font> from time to time. You can also use the
shortcut key <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font> to check out the skills you already know.
