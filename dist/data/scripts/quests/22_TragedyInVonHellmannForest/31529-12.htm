Ok. Then, let's talk about the method. First, take this jewelry. If you hit
the well, the spirits will come out.<br> While you are fighting with the
spirits, I will break the seal of the hidden report in the well<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Just, don't kill the spirit while I'm working. Because
    they will come back to the well if they die.</font><br>
If I break the seal, the color of the jewelry will change. After that, you
can kill the spirit or do whatever you want. You got it?<br>
