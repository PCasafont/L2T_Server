<body>Grand Magister Halaster:<br>
The Town of Goddard has produced many brave war heroes over the years, but it is also well-regarded as a center of
learning and study.<br>
Do not underestimate these people simply because they live in a relatively wild and untamed region. In fact, the harsher
their lives become, the greater their thirst for knowledge. That knowledge is far more than academic, you understand --
it has the power to improve their chances of survival.<br>
