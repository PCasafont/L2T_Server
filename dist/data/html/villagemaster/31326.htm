<body>High Prefect Lambac:<br>
Even though we have the reputation as the top Warrior training camp in the entire kingdom, I, High Prefect Lambac, am
almost mad with frustration at having to train with these fragile Humans and Elves! If I exert even a little strength,
their bones snap like twigs, or they swoon like a lovesick girl...<br>
Tejakar Orka! True training must be between Orcs!<br>
