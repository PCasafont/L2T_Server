<body>Priestess of Light Razen:<br>The power you attained through <font color="LEVEL">Awakening</font> is indeed great,
but it is the power of the Giants. <font color="LEVEL">Skills</font> in particular are the essence of the Giants'
abilities. <br>But against Triol the devil, the greatest weapon would be the power of light bestowed by Einhasad the
goddess.<br>No need to regret your Awakening, however. Excluding skills and servitors' abilities, all of your general
attacks are imbued with the <font color="LEVEL">power of the light inside you</font>. They will be critical in defeating
the pagans. <br>Also, remember that you will be kicked out if you <font color="LEVEL">hunt with 5 or more
    comrades</font> in this waiting room.<br><br>
