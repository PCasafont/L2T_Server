<body>Zephyra:<br>There's so much we don't know about in the Material Realm. They require us to pay with Adena for
everything.<br>So I started my research with Veruti. I also got help from the spirits. Research was hard, but then we
discovered a new skill that can save Adena by creating valuable goods.<br>So, do you want to join my research? By the
way, only Lv. 40 or above Ertheia who have completed their 1st Liberation may learn Alchemy.<br>
