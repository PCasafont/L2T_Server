<body>Blacksmith Pinter:<br>
Welcome! What can I do for you this fine day? Go ahead, ask me anything. I'm a 3rd-generation blacksmith and a proud
Dwarf. In fact, I'll wager my shop that you won't find another Dwarf in these parts with a fuller beard! Ha! I will tell
you in all humility, though, that I am a master of my profession. I'm sure there is nothing beyond my skills.<br>
