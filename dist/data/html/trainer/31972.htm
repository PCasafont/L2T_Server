<body>Magister Atraxia:<br>
I have been here for some time now, but I still have trouble with this cold weather. When it gets too frigid, I endure
it by thinking of my balmy Elven homeland.<br>
We Elves are closely attuned to our environment. That is the essence of our magic and our strength. May Einhasad guide
you on your path, my friend.<br><br>
