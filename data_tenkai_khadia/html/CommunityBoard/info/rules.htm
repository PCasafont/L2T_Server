<br>
- Respect all other players in the game, as well as in the forum! This also includes the L2Tenkai staff. Being verbally aggressive and/or destructive is a permanent ban reason, so if you are pissed for anything, think twice before posting here or shouting ingame.<br>
- Play fair! This includes reporting exploitable bugs before abusing them as well as not tricking other players.<br>
- Any kind of explicit postings and statements are prohibited. This includes racism, pornography, discrimination and all kinds of political propaganda.<br>
- The staff of L2Tenkai has the administrative sovereignty. Their decisions must be accepted at any time and can deviate from the rule set.<br>
- Common sense is to be used for all the ingame actions and transactions. We will not compensate the lack of it.

<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Accounts]</font><br1>
- You may only have one forum/website account. There is no limitation of how many game accounts you may create within this account.<br>
- In case you want to create a forum/website account for a friend who can't (for any reason) create his own account, then name it significantly different than your own account.<br>
- The sharing of accounts is NOT ALLOWED, doesn't matter if is with your mother, your brother or your funny friend.<br>
- You are the ONLY RESPONSIBLE from your account, what you do with your account is ONLY YOUR PROBLEM and the server staff DON'T give support if your account get leaked because your shared it, you use a weak password (or a password that you already used at other server) or you get infected by some shit sent by other players.<br>
- You as account owner are responsible for all actions done with it. This means you will also suffer punishments, if someone else logs your account and violates this rule set.<br>
- When you create a character, its nick must not violate any point of this rule set, else it can get renamed or banned. Your nick may include standard English characters and numbers.<br>
- All created accounts are property of the server owners and can be deleted, banned or modified at any time. Selling of accounts or items for real money is forbidden.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Behavior]</font><br1>
- The first of the basic rules has highest priority. This means that insulting other players is forbidden and will be punished by the staff. Flaming, to a certain extent, is considered part of the game by most players and we will tolerate it as long as you don't seriously insult other players.<br>
- Don't behave like a troll, this means, no racism, no caps-lock, no "THIS IS A JOKE?", no "OH MY GOD" or "WTF"?
 You won't get previous warning for trolling, this is, you will be banned or punished as soon as you behave like a troll.<br>
- Don't make a hobby out of reporting other people for average flame or even lesser insults, which are considered as colloquial in real life too.<br>
- Don't annoy staff members or other players. This includes spamming of whispers, trades and begging for items or Adena.<br>
- Accusing other players of being "GM friend, edited, etc." will not be tolerated. Also don't slander players of being member of the staff. Keep such thoughts for yourself, no matter how sure you are that you are right. No staff members play in L2Tenkai, but If you bully someone with such allegations, you can receive a serious punishment.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Use of the ingame chat]</font><br1>
- The behavior guidelines apply to all chats. In addition, each chat must be used for it's designated purpose.<br>
- Trade chat is for trading. Continuous spam of same offers or requests is undesirable. The preferable language for the trade chat is English with the common trading terms wtb, wts and wtt. Since all tradable items have an English name, use it for the trade chat please, so all players can understand you.<br>
- Shout chat is for general conversations. Do not use this chat to start or sustain a verbal war.<br>
- The content of hero chat conversations are subject to the same conditions like that shout chat.<br>
- Misuse of the chats will lead to temporary expulsion from them (chat ban). In case of violation of the first basic rule, harder punishments can be applied. Advertising for other servers will result in a permanent expulsion from the community.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Gameplay]</font><br1>
- PvP and PK are allowed unless you take part in an event which is organized by a staff member and which is obviously a non-PvP event.<br>
- High level characters are not allowed to molest low level characters. This rule doesn't apply if the low level character is on his subclass and has the possibility to defend himself by switching to his main class or has other high level characters to defend his low level ones.<br>
- In the low level areas around the starting villages it's also forbidden for high levels to attack newbies unless provoked by them. Keep in mind that we need to welcome new people, not discourage them to join our server.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Olympiad]</font><br1>
- Participants of the Olympiad are not allowed to intentionally lose against others in order to transfer points (feeding). This violates the fair play basic rule and will lead to temporary expulsion from the Olympiad for the feeder and all chars on accounts which are in any connection (IP/Forum account) to the feeder.<br>
- If anyone feeds you against your will, you must report him immediately to the forum, including documentation (videos are prefered, as usual).<br>
- It is not allowed to compete in an Olympiad game against an other character belonging to you. Never have 2 or more characters registered to the Olympiad game at the same time. Doing so will lead to a temporary expulsion from the Olympiad games for the rest of the month of all of the players characters.<br>
- All documentations of Olympiad feed must include a visibly displayed date. You can see the current date by using the .time command. So do this first, whenever you want to make a screenshot for reporting.<br>
- There is limitation on how many characters with hero status a player may own: you are allowed to have only one hero character, that is, one hero/IP. If you violate this rule, you will be removed your hero status on every character.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[Third party software]</font><br1>
- The use of third party software (even talk about them), like bots, packet hacks, etc. is forbidden. All you may use to connect to L2Tenkai is your Lineage 2 client.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[List of punishments - noncommital]</font><br1>
- Misuse of a chat > Temporary chat ban.<br>
- Offending staff > Temporary ban.<br>
- Feeding in the Olympiad > Hero lost and oly points decreased to 0.<br>
- Abusing of bugs > Permanent ban.<br>
- Any kind of Advertising > Permanent ban.<br>
- Using external software > Permanent ban.<br>
